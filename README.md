## 📊 Project Overview:
- **Objective:** 
  - Develop models for price prediction, delivery time estimation, and customer satisfaction analysis to streamline logistics operations.
- **Dataset:** 
  - 10,000 records and 17 features, including:
    - Route distance
    - Vehicle type
    - Material weight
    - Traffic/weather conditions
    - Customer ratings, and more.

## 🚀 Key Use Cases & Achievements:
### 1. **Price Prediction:**
- Developed a **Random Forest Regressor**, achieving:
  - **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): ₹8,673**
- Fine-tuned the model using **XGBoost**, reducing RMSE to **₹8,336** for improved pricing strategies.

### 2. **Delivery Time Estimation:**
- Built a **Decision Tree Regressor**, achieving:
  - **RMSE: 5.05 hours**
- Incorporated features like traffic and weather conditions to enhance prediction accuracy.

### 3. **Delay Prediction:**
- Trained a **Random Forest Classifier** to identify delivery delays, achieving:
  - **Accuracy: 50.4%**
- Analyzed key factors contributing to delays for strategic improvements.

### 4. **Customer Satisfaction Analysis:**
- Predicted customer ratings using **Linear Regression**, achieving:
  - **RMSE: 0.58**
- Classified satisfaction levels with **Logistic Regression**, achieving:
  - **Accuracy: 51.55%**

### 5. **Feature Engineering & Clustering:**
- Performed advanced feature engineering, including one-hot encoding for categorical variables.
- Grouped customers and routes using **KMeans clustering** to optimize service strategies.

### 6. **Advanced Model Optimization:**
- Leveraged **LightGBM** and **CatBoost** for price and delay predictions, achieving further improvements through hyperparameter tuning.
